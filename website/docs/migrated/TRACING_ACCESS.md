# How to Access Traces

Use this page as a quick entry point. For full details, see [TRACING_GUIDE.md](./TRACING_GUIDE.md).

## Quick Steps
1. Generate a lesson on `/` and wait for status “generated”.
2. Open the lesson detail page.
3. Expand “AI Generation Traces & Debug Info”.

## If traces don’t appear
- New lesson not finished: wait and refresh.
- Old lesson created before tracing: generate a new lesson.
- Database missing `traces` table: run migrations from `supabase/migrations`.

## Next
- Debug and deep dive: read [TRACING_GUIDE.md](./TRACING_GUIDE.md).
